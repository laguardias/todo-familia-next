Plans:

1- Make action "createTodo" to make todo with userId from current logged user;

2- Verify action "getTodos" to see if it's working properly;

2- Make action to delete todo;

3- Make action to edit todo;

4- Improve the Schemas for users to share todos with other users;

5- Implement the share todos system;





Shadcn: 

1- I still haven't been able to use the shadcn select;

2- Input from shadcn doesn't get the required property;

3- Still about shadcn: can you have several buttons with different colors or just primary and secondary, etc?
